# Web Devlopment - Session 2: HTML Basics

## Overview

This is **Session 2** of the web development.  
In this session, we focus on **HTML fundamentals** and expand the semantic structure introduced in Session 1. The project introduces **more HTML tags** and organizes content into meaningful sections.

## Features

- Enhanced semantic HTML structure:
  - `<header>` with navigation
  - `<main>` for primary content
  - `<section>` for topic divisions
  - `<footer>` for site information
- Added **HTML element cards** for reference:
  - `<ul>`: Unordered list
  - `<li>`: List item
  - `<h1> - <h6>`: Headings
- Each card includes a **short description**.
- Consistent **responsive layout** using CSS from Session 1.
