# Session 5 - CSS Polish: Transitions, Transforms, Responsive Images

## Tasks

- Create hover/focus transitions and transform-based micro-interactions.
- Add responsive images using `srcset` and `sizes`.

## Deliverables

Make sure to **commit both `index.html` and `components.css`** along with the responsive images (`small`, `medium`, `large` versions) to demonstrate the final setup.
