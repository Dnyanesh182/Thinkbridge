# HTML Foundations: Semantic Profile Page

## Project Overview

This project is part of **Session 3: HTML Foundations**.  
The goal is to practice building a **semantic HTML structure** by creating a profile page using elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`.

The project is validated using **W3C HTML Validator** and can be previewed locally with **Live Server**.
